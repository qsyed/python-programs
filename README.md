## CRUD-sqlite3
> This project utilizes the python libraries BeautifulSoup, sqlite3, and requests. A user can input how many pages of data from the website, https://books.toscrape.com/ The program gets every book's title, price, and rating and saves it to an sqlite database. From the command line a user can start to use the promoted commands to interact with the database. A user can delete, update, and search for specific items.
